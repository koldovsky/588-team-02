                    <b>Among the semi-dry red wines of Georgia, Pirosmani is worth mentioning. This wine is deep

                        according to the Imeretian technology. The key difference from the Kakhetian one is that during

                        called masculine because of its high tannin, density and rich taste. The only way to drink this
                        drink is long and small sips.It is made from Saperavi and therefore has a deep ruby ​​color.

                    <h4>1992</h4>
                    <p>Italy has a long tradition of winemaking, using its grape varieties and its methods,
                        which in recent years have become increasingly sophisticated.
                        Even when Italian winemakers use international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Chardonnay,
                        or modern techniques such as aging in new oak barrels, they give the wine a distinctive "Italian accent".</p>
