                                    <p>The local ice wine deserves special attention - ice wine made from grapes harvested after
                                        freezing. It makes a drink with a raisin flavor. Its production technology is expensive and
                                        costly, which is why ice wine is called a precious wine. After all, much less drink is obtained
                                        from frozen grapes. In addition, the grapes must also freeze properly - the temperature cannot
                                        be lower than –8 ºС.

                                    <p>Ursta offers nine varieties of wine for tasting. The subject of his special pride is the Unicum
                                        wine made from dried dark grapes (Saperavi, Dove and Cake Francoche). Also among the author's
                                        finds are the “Black Doctor” semi-sweet red vintage wine and the “Nectar” semi-sweet white
                                        blended wine. The list also includes Riesling, Saperavi, Cahors.
