                        </b>
                        <h3>Dry red wine</h3>
                        <b>Among the dry red wines of Georgia, it is worth highlighting:Teliani. Dry red table wine, on
                            average, has a strength of 10 to 12%; Saperavi; Kvareli. It is also produced from Saperavi

                        <b>Among the semi-dry red wines of Georgia, Pirosmani is worth mentioning. This wine is deep
                            burgundy in color. Its interesting feature is that it is naturally semi-dry. It is produced
                            according to the Imeretian technology. The key difference from the Kakhetian one is that during
                            the fermentation the grape twigs are separated.</b>

                            called masculine because of its high tannin, density and rich taste. The only way to drink this
                            drink is long and small sips.It is made from Saperavi and therefore has a deep ruby ​​color.

            <p>Indigenous grape varieties have been bred 
            in Georgia and there is a natural zoning of vines by varieties.
            Own wine production technologies have been created: Kakheti, 
            Imereti and Racha-Lechkhum (or production of semi-sweet wines)</p>

            <h3>Italian Wines</h3>
            <h3>1992</h3>
            <p>Italy has a long tradition of winemaking, using its grape varieties and its methods,
             which in recent years have become increasingly sophisticated. 
             Even when Italian winemakers use international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Chardonnay, 
             or modern techniques such as aging in new oak barrels, they give the wine a distinctive "Italian accent".</p>
