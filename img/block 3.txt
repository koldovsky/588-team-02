        <h3>Italian Wines</h3>
        <h3>1992</h3>
        <p>Italy has a long tradition of winemaking, using its grape varieties and its methods,
         which in recent years have become increasingly sophisticated. 
         Even when Italian winemakers use international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Chardonnay, 
         or modern techniques such as aging in new oak barrels, they give the wine a distinctive "Italian accent".</p>
